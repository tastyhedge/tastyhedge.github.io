      <description>In this post, you will learn how to calibrate American options in C++ with modern methods and open-source tools, so that calibration will be really fast with source code open to review.&#xA;Source code itself is located in gituliar/tastyhedge repo on GitHub, which you can build and run it on Linux or Windows. This repo also contains all necessary market data to reproduce discussed examples.&#xA;Calibration is a process of fitting parameters of the model to the market data.</description>

      <title>Pricing Americans with Finite-Difference</title>

      <description>In my previous post Pricing Derivatives on a Budget I discussed performance of the finite-difference algorithm for pricing American options on CPU vs GPU. Since then, people have asked to elaborate on the pricing algorithm itself. Hence, this post is dedicated to the Finite-Difference Method.&#xA;C++ is a great language to implement a finite-difference pricer on CPU and GPU. You&amp;rsquo;ll find full source code from the previous post on GitHub in gituliar/kwinto-cuda repo.</description>

      <description>After five years working as a quant, I can tell that the wast majority of derivative pricing in the financial industry is done on CPU. This is easily explained by two facts: (1) no GPU was available when banks started developing their pricing analytics in 90&amp;rsquo;s; and (2) banking is a conservative sector, slow to upgrade its technical stack.&#xA;American Options. In this post, I benchmark pricing of American Options on GPU.</description>

      <description>For a professional C++ developer, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand memory organization of the data structures, especially when it comes to the containers from the C++ Standard Library. In this post of Tasty C++ series we&amp;rsquo;ll look inside of std::string, so that you can more effectively work with C++ strings and take advantage and avoid pitfalls of the C++ Standard Library you are using.&#xA;In C++ Standard Library, std::string is one of the three contiguous containers (together with std::array and std::vector).</description>
